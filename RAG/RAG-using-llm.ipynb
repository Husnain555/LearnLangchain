American ships have been sunk, American lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way.\\n\\nThere has been no discrimination. The challenge is to all mankind.\\n\\nEach nation must decide for itself how it will meet it.\\n\\nThe choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation.\\n\\nWe must put excited feeling away.\\n\\nOur motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we are only a single champion.\\n\\nWhen I addressed the Congress on the 26th of February last, I thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms, our right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence.\\n\\nBut armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable.\\n\\nBecause submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the German submarines have been used, against merchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against pirates.\\n\\nThe German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend.\\n\\nThe intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be.\\n\\nArmed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions, it is worse than ineffectual: it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents.\\n\\nThere is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: we will not choose the path of submission.\\n\\nWe will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated.\\n\\nWith a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the Government and people of the United States.\\n\\nThat it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it.\\n\\nAnd that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense, but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end the war.\\n\\nWhat this will involve is clear.\\n\\nIt will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with Germany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs.\\n\\nIt will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible.\\n\\nIt will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemyâ€™s submarines.\\n\\nIt will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United States, already provided for by law, in case of war, at least five hundred thousand men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service.\\n\\nIt will involve the bringing to the service of the government the entire financial power of the country in order that the resources of the country may be marshaled and organized in aid of the nation.\\n\\nIt will involve the development of an economic mobilization.\\n\\nIt will involve the immediate enlistment of not only of the men, but of all the energy, enthusiasm, and intelligence of the country.\\n\\nIt is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance.\\n\\nBut the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts.\\n\\nFor democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for\\n\\n')]\n"
